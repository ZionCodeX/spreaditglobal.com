                We are able to serve customers in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Benin Republic, Cote D'Ivoire, Uganda. However, you must note that for us to ship directly from China to any country outside Nigeria, the estimated weight of your order must be at least 10kg. If it is not up to 10kg, we will not be able to do direct shipping to countries outside Nigeria. When we do direct shipping, we will either ship directly to the address you provided or our clearing agents in these countries would give you a call to pick up your order at their location.

For customers in Ghana, if your order is not up to 10kg, you can still use our platform but note that your order must get to Nigeria first, then we use ABC Express to send to Ghana. You will receive a tracking code and will pick up from ABC park in Accra. This will likely be at an extra cost to you.            </div>

                Our standard timeline is 10 to 20 working days from the date your order was approved by our order approval team. This is important as many customers usually start counting from when they paid for their orders. You can pay for an order and the order will be approved after two or more days due to mistakes in your order. We will approve correctly placed orders the same day except for weekends or public holidays. All things being equal, all orders arrive at our Lagos office within 10 to 20 WORKING days.

            <div class="elementskit-faq-body">
                Many mini importers, especially first-time importers do not understand all the costs involved in importation. Shipping cost can wipe out or reduce considerably your profit margin especially if you are trying to import products that are already in the market.<br>

When you import without an idea of what the shipping cost to your country could be, you may end up abandoning your goods when they arrive and are told your shipping cost. To forestall this, we introduced estimated cost calculation and payment at the time of placing your order.            </div>

                Refunds arise for many reasons. When you make mistakes in your order, say you chose the wrong price for the product you want to import. When this happens, our team will place your order on hold. You can choose to remove the product if increasing the price to the right price will go above your budget. When this happens, a refund will be created for you. When the estimated shipping cost is more than the actual shipping cost, our system will create a refund for you. Lastly, When you cancel an order, a refund will be created for you.             </div>

An approved order can be placed on hold if the order has issues as raised by our procurement team in China. At this time, you must pay attention to the issues raised as you may not be required to cancel the order. You may simply be required to edit a piece of information.

            <div class="elementskit-faq-body">
                Delays arise for a number of reasons: You made mistakes when placing your order. This kind of mistake is usually caught by our Lagos order approval team. The supplier does not have exactly what you ordered. In this case, we will revert to you, make suggestions and carry out your instructions. The supplier does not have what you ordered but conceals that from us. In this case, we can only find out after about 72 hours and the supplier has not shipped your order. This will most likely lead to outright cancellation of the order, for a single product order or cancellation of the product in a multi-product order. When you order from a supplier that is very far from our office in Guangzhou. When you order too many products in one order, we will have to wait for all your order to arrive at our China office before we ship out. This can take time. We could choose to move your order in batches and you will know which ones have been shipped and the ones that are outstanding.            </div>
